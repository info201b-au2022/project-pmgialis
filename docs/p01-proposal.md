## Abstract
In this project, we will be delving into the implications of sleep quality and quantity on human health. We will be using already recorded sleep data, and analyzing trends in each of the categories.

## Keywords
Sleep, exercise, sleeping disorders, workout, cardiac rhythm, healthy
 ## Introduction
The project that our group came up with was on sleep. Sleep is part of human well-being. Humans need sleep in order to function throughout the day. It is believed that adults need less hours of sleep than children who need to develop. We think that sleep is important if you want to be able to think, learn, and act to the best of your ability. Many college students, like us, do not get enough sleep and therefore we wanted to make our project on sleep. We want to learn and be able to share the information we obtain to others. Our main focus is on sleep and how exercise and other activities and/or disorders affect it.

## Problem Domain
Because sleep is crucial to life, analyzing how different varieties of sleep affect human health is extremely important. In today’s day, people often normalize fewer hours of sleep, and ignore the ramifications of this choice. As people often do not reach their recommended amount of sleep each night, the world becomes increasingly more reliant on more waking hours, creating health concerns.
* Direct Stakeholders: The direct stakeholders are those who directly interact with the system. For our project some of the direct stakeholders are those that work in the medical fields as they may need some data on sleep and thus, they can interact directly with our system.
* Indirect Stakeholders: Indirect stakeholders are different from the direct stakeholders. Indirect stakeholders refers to those who may be affected by a system without using it themselves. Some of the indirect stakeholders for our project are citizens. If people don’t learn about the importance of sleep they will continue to normalize sleeping less hours and this will affect their health.


## Research Questions
1. **Why is sleep important?**
Knowing how sleep affects our daily lives we can better understand how what we do affects it.
2. **Does exercise increase or decrease how sleepy a person is?**
We want to focus on how the activities we do, especially those that can get a human tired just like moving a lot throughout the day or working out, has any effect on our sleep.
3. **How does sleep work?**
What happens in our brains and to our bodies as we sleep. It’s important to know this as this helps us understand if not sleeping enough for a day or several days can affect how we think and learn.

## The Dataset
Why: This dataset collects data from 2014-2018. This dataset is related to our problem in that it's data that was collected by someone who wanted to know about their sleep cycle. This information will enable us to answer the research questions in that it shows the amount of activity that this person did and how much sleep they obtained that day.

Key Questions: The data was collected by Data Diotte between 2014-2018. It was recently updated in April of 2022. The purpose of the data being collected was because Diotte wanted to compare that data to other people's data. This data was collected using the Sleep Cycle iOS app. People searching for data on sleep like us, benefit from the data that Dana collected.

## Expected Implications
* A possible expected implication could be how designers, like those who construct the sleep data and program for Apple, build their UI to suggest healthy sleeping habits. If they know how much sleep is necessary for the type of person using the program, they can give better suggestions and analysis which will cause the user to trust the program more.
* Another implication may be considering different variables that affects the timeline and the quality of someone’s sleep. It can provide insight, perhaps, to technologists about how screen time before sleep affects a user. This can influence how they design products later on. For example, Apple has Night Mode and Night Shift that is easier on the eyes before bed and less stimulating. It encourages the user to get off of their phone and go to bed with Sleep Mode and its wind down feature as well. Other variables could include exercise, caffeine consumption, if they napped during the day, etc.

## Limitations
* A possible limitation would be that a lot of this data is self-reported and may not be entirely accurate. Some variables, like time asleep or on screens may be less specific. Other variables like exercise intensity can be more subjective. Other influences, for example caffeine consumption, could be recorded incorrectly as well. Other studies with medical devices or specific sleep devices measuring the data will be more accurate. It will be important to avoid any complications with this by not manipulating data together that wouldn’t make sense because of how it is measured.
* Another limitation might be how different the studies are in the ways they are performed or recorded. As described previously, some are self-reported and others measured by devices. In addition, some record different aspects of sleep, like time asleep versus quality. Because they are different, it’s important to consider this throughout the report and in the way data is interpreted, analyzed, and manipulated. However, having data for multiple different variables will be valuable in creating a nuanced understanding of sleep and what influences it.
