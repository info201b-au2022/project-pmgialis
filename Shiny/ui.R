      Some of the questions that we had and that we mainly focus our project in
      is on how much does stress affect your sleep? Another question was that in 
      the data frame that we found there where levels of the limb movement. We 
      decided to use this data as a correlation with exercise. Therefore in the 
      bar graph shown in this project there is data shown about stress and the 
      amount of sleep. The healthier you are which can be improved by working out
      the better sleep you will obtain.")

  mainPanel(
    p("The first interactive visualization, Limb Movement over Time in Sleep, and the second interactive visualization, Time Slept over Recorded Stress Levels, both display clear patterns in the data. The first visualization depicts some yellow lines and a blue line. The yellow lines are the points from the dataset, and the blue line illustrates the correlation between these points, showing a negative, nearly linear slope. This means that the more sleeping hours pass, the less limb movement there will be throughout the night, reflecting an indirect relationship between the two variables. This can also be due to the sleep REM cycle, which reduced limb movement in deep sleep. Limb movement can also be a sign of sleep disruption, which is more likely to occur at earlier points in the sleep cycle as people are easier to wake up. The second interactive visualization compares time slept for recorded stress levels in a stacked bar graph. At stress level 1, the person is averaging six to seven hours. At level 2, hours are ranging from to 3.5 to 4.6, with an outlier at 2.5 hours. At stress level 3, the hours are much shorter, within a range of 0.8 to 2.0 hours, with two outliers around 0.2 hours. There is clear evidence for a consistent decrease in sleep hours as stress levels continue. It is probable to assume that as stress levels get higher, a personâ€™s hours asleep will continue to decrease and quality will be reduced as well. As mentioned before, exercise can be a great way to release stress during the day, which can assist a person in getting more quality and longer sleep at night.")
