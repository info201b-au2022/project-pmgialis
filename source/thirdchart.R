# Short Paragraph
  # When a person workouts the amount of oxygen that their body needs increases.
  # In this graph it shows how the amount of blood oxygen (bo) as its increasing,
  # the amount of hours of sleep (sr.1) is also increasing. This answers one of
  # the questions that we had about how physical activity can affect your body (in
  # this case the blood oxygen), and how this can have an influence on the amount
  # of sleep that a person gets.
